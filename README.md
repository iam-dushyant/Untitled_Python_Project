# Introduction

# Dataset
This synthetic dataset comprises 20,000 records of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for risk assessment. It serves two primary purposes:

1. Risk Score Regression: To predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.
2. Binary Classification: To determine the binary outcome of loan approval, indicating whether an applicant is likely to be approved or denied for a loan.
